# NOTE: This workflow builds the protocol image from the protocol repo.
# It works because protocol is public (GITHUB_TOKEN can checkout public repos).
# If protocol ever goes private, this needs a PAT secret.
# Conceptually this workflow belongs in the protocol repo — consider moving it
# there once the image build/publish pipeline is formalized.
